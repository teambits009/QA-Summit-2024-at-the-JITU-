# QA-Summit-2024-at-the-JITU-
This repository contains the lessons learnt during the QA Summit at the JITU held on July 5th 2024. Its more focused on the short notes. Check them out in the README section. 
QE Testing using Locust. 
Bnefits of using Locust; It provides you with detailed results 
Easy to use; You don't need a lot of effort to get started. 

To Install it; do a PIP Install Locust. It's a simple Python file. The http request works hand in hand with the python file. 
Testing a POST route, PUT route, the GET route and the DELETE route. 

Configuring the number of users using Locust and getting to improve test the APIs before it goes out to production. It gets to simulate the number of users who get to use the APIs. The ramp number of APIs also gets to increase as its connected to the URL in the APIs. Locust gets to create the chats you can use for your tests results. The graph gets to show the Total request per Second, the Response Time, The Number of Users. The High the number of users, the high the 
response time of the APIs being used in the application. Response Times, Total Requests and the Number Of Users, it also gives you a CSV file straight out of Locust. It get's to give you the visualization tools that you can use when working on your test results. All of you have to do is to create a simple file and load it on Locust as you try to identify some of the places where you will experience some of the challenges in the process. 

Great Expectations as a Tool For Data Quality In Data Pipelines. 
Uniqueness, Completeness, Validity, Timeliness, Accuracy. 
- In the data aspect, we don't need to have duplicates, Completeness is where we expect you to have all the data of your customere i.e there location and where they can make there payments from. 

Expectations; 
- What you expect of your data,
-  To not have Nulls
-  To be of a certain data type e.g String Type
-  To be unique and also the expectations type. 

Emerging trends of the QA/QE Field 
- Most of the companies before delivering Softwares, they have to ensure they test there tools, they use Postman and Locust.
- Other tools also include Behaviour, Great Expectation Anomalos

Trends that have been created in QA/QE 
- Software developer Interest for collaboration. Tools include Agile etc
- These tools work hand in hand to test codes and connect with the users, User tesing and User Experience testing in QA/QE
- Component testing in the websites; You get to use Selenium, Playwrite and Cypress.
- Innovative Testing approaches have grown in different areas, using AI to automate areas and counter checking the results of various tests. Rapid tests for also testing various automation cases in these field.

  Cypress is used in testing tools that are automated most of the time. That means all the functionalities built in the system are seamless and very flexible.

  Open Source tools to learn Data Quality. Identify the tool you would like to use, Great Expectation, Apache Griffy, Jupyter Notebooks as your playground. 

The Programming tools used in data quality checks, Python, SQL and R. You can use Python-Apache Spark. Most development tool integrate very well with Cypruss. Behaviour driven developments can also be predescribed in the process when 
triggering the Cypress Tests. React, Vue and Angular. Again you don't have to be good at data modeling to be able to create high level systems. You need to work on tutorials and build up through the projects.The best online resources to get started with Cypress, YouTube does well at that and also if you prefer reading through various documentations and also get to join a bootcamp that will you get started at the end of the day. API(Application Programming Interface)
